Simple project to exercise SeleniumIDE -> JUnit + WebDriver implementation

Some ideas and very simple implementation of using SeleniumIDE to generate JUnit 4 / WebDriver code and how to modify it for slightly better architechture.

Emphasis is on small effort, readability. 

(Later maybe separation of concerns and some component dependant utilities to help with locating elements.)
